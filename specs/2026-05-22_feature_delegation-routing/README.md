# Delegation Routing — Trace Log

**Status**: Planning
**Started**: 2026-05-22
**Branch**: `worktree-explore-agent-routing` (worktree off `main`)
**Lead**: TBD (pending persona selection)

## Overview

Two-tier delegation model where Opus is the primary orchestrator/personality for
all top-level agents, with delegation downward in two distinct shapes:

1. **Ephemeral delegations** — on-demand spawns by Opus for mechanical work
   (mostly Qwen): lookup, file ops, media gen coordination, data crunch,
   translation/formatting.
2. **Persistent role agents** — first-class agent entries with their own model
   + personality, bound to channels:
   - Qwen-backed: Ops, Data, Research
   - Opus-backed: Code/Dev, Writing

The naming for the two tiers ("sub-agent" vs "task agent" vs alternatives like
"delegation/persona", "worker/agent") is intentionally left open during
planning — see plan.md for the recommendation.

## Session Log

### 2026-05-22 — Session Start

- User invoked `/glados:plan-feature` after deciding to explore the routing
  strategy in a worktree off `main`.
- Working in worktree `.claude/worktrees/explore-agent-routing` on branch
  `worktree-explore-agent-routing`.
- Feature name confirmed: `delegation-routing` (spec dir
  `specs/2026-05-22_feature_delegation-routing/`).
- User deferred two open questions to GLaDOS exploration:
  1. Whether ephemeral and persistent delegations should be **unified** or
     remain **two distinct concepts** in the model.
  2. **Terminology** for the two tiers.
- Context anchors provided up front (CLAUDE.md, Feature #27 Local Model
  Routing live on AWS, channel × runtime compat matrix):
  - Per-agent model binding already lives in `agents/<name>/agent.yaml`
    (overlay, `model:` block) — schema v1, strict-keyed.
  - Telegram is Hermes-only post v2026.5; Slack works on both OpenClaw +
    Hermes.
  - Three providers (local/remote/AWS), all per-agent Docker containers.
  - Per-agent config split documented in
    `product-knowledge/standards/config-taxonomy.md`.

## Active Personas

- **Architect** — system integrity, fit with existing Runtime/Provider/overlay
  architecture, schema impact, technical debt risk.
- **Product Manager** — user value, scope, naming legibility for operators, MVP
  carve-out.
- **QA** — testability of multi-model agents, regression risk on Feature #27
  (Local Model Routing — live on AWS), edge cases (missing secret, unreachable
  endpoint, model fallback semantics under delegation).

## Available Capabilities (this codebase)

- Go test runner (`go test ./...`) — overlay validation, runtime config
  generation, channel binding.
- Code search / file ops — read-mostly during planning.
- Live AWS environment — Feature #27 is in production with one agent on a
  self-hosted LLM. Can dogfood new overlay shape against the same flow.
- No browser/UI work — this is pure runtime + config architecture.

## Decisions

Recorded in `plan.md` "Key Design Decisions" — short list here for the trace:

1. **Two tiers stay distinct** (Architect's call on user-deferred question).
   Tier 1 lives in `agent.yaml` (runtime config); Tier 2 lives as Conga agents
   provisioned via `--role` shorthand.
2. **Terminology**: "**delegate**" (Tier 1, ephemeral) + "**role agent**"
   (Tier 2, persistent). Avoids collisions with Anthropic Task tool /
   sub-agent vocabulary and with GLaDOS persona vocabulary.
3. **Tier 1 delegation is a runtime concern, not a Conga concern.** Conga
   ships the overlay shape; the runtime decides when to delegate. No
   Bifrost-style routing proxy in this feature.
4. **Role = curated overlay package** (Phase 3 Route A). No new
   `AgentConfig.Role` field. Roles are directories under
   `agents/_defaults/<runtime>/<role>/` shipped with SOUL.md, AGENTS.md,
   agent.yaml. `conga admin add-user --role X` is sugar.

## Files Created

- [requirements.md](requirements.md)
- [plan.md](plan.md)

## Open Questions Carried Into Spec

See `plan.md` "Open Questions To Close In spec.md" — seven items, with
upstream-capability (OpenClaw + Hermes delegation mechanism at `v2026.5.18`)
as the load-bearing first one.

## Next Step

`/glados:spec-feature` — start with the Phase 1 upstream capability check
before locking the v2 overlay shape.

### 2026-05-22 — Session Resume (Spec Phase)

User invoked `/glados:spec-feature` immediately after plan acceptance.
Re-read requirements.md and plan.md. Active personas unchanged
(Architect + PM + QA). First substantive work: the upstream capability
check (Phase 1 of plan.md) — load-bearing for the v2 overlay shape.

### 2026-05-22 — Phase 1 findings + decisions

[upstream-capability.md](upstream-capability.md) written. Both OpenClaw
v2026.5.18 and Hermes have mature native support for in-runtime
delegation (OpenClaw: `sessions_spawn` + `agents.defaults.subagents`;
Hermes: `delegate_task` + `delegation:`).

Decisions resolved with user:

- **Tier 1 rename: "delegate" → "subagent"** (OpenClaw upstream already
  uses "delegate" for org-identity agents — collision flagged in
  upstream-capability.md). Aaron confirmed the rename.
- **Overlay shape: single sub-agent model, not a list** — matches both
  runtimes' single-string config; per-spawn overrides happen at runtime.
- **Tier 2 unchanged: "role agent"** — still distinct from upstream
  "delegate."
- **Egress: Option 3 (auto-derive + warn at provision time)**.
- **Role catalog: ship all 5** (Ops, Data, Research, Code/Dev, Writing).

### 2026-05-22 — Persona Review (post-spec.md)

**Acting as Architect** (priority: architecture, standards, performance):

- **Q: Does this introduce a new dependency?** No — reuses existing
  yaml.v3, no new imports. ✅
- **Q: How does this affect existing data models?** `AgentOverlay` gains
  one optional field (`Subagents *SubagentsOverlay`); `AgentConfig`
  unchanged; provider JSON/SSM persistence unchanged. Minimal blast
  radius. Verified the design honors Route A (no `Role` field). ✅
- **Q: Is this pattern consistent with the rest of the codebase?**
  Yes — schema v1→v2 bump uses the exact migration mechanism Feature #27
  established. Generator helpers (`applySubagentsOverlay`) mirror
  `applyModelOverlay`. ✅
- **Concern raised**: spec says subagent model is **merged into the
  models allowlist** in OpenClaw (so `/model` switch can also reach it).
  Verify this is intended — could conflict with operators who want
  subagent invisible from chat. Architect verdict: **acceptable** —
  matches Feature #27's "additive allowlist" principle; lockdown remains
  an egress-policy concern, not an allowlist-trim concern.
- **Concern raised**: same-provider conflict rejection (primary +
  subagent both `openai` with different `base_url`s) is a real
  ergonomic limitation. v3 may need to relax this via per-provider-id
  scoping. Logged in "Out-of-scope."
- **Verdict: APPROVE** — design fits architecture; no debt incurred.

**Acting as Product Manager** (priority: user-value, scope, requirements):

- **Q: What problem does this solve for the user?** Qwen alone isn't a
  viable primary; Opus alone is too expensive. Two-tier delegation lets
  Opus drive personality + Qwen handle mechanical work. Aaron's brief
  was explicit on this. ✅
- **Q: Is this critical for the MVP?** This IS the MVP for the
  delegation routing roadmap. The five-role catalog gives operators
  an immediate value (`--role code-dev` provisions a working Opus +
  Qwen agent in one command). ✅
- **Q: How will we measure success?** Spec lists 8 acceptance criteria
  in requirements.md success criteria. Quantifiable: (a) live-smoke a
  `--role code-dev` agent; (b) verify subagent spawn via runtime logs;
  (c) no regression on Feature #27 AWS production agent. ✅
- **Concern raised**: spec's role catalog table has the same model name
  (`qwen-2.5-72b-instruct`) hardcoded for multiple roles. Operators
  running on Spark/LiteLLM may have a different model name. PM verdict:
  **acceptable** — the role package ships defaults; per-agent overlay
  override is documented in spec section "Role catalog (initial five)".
- **Concern raised**: `role-` prefix in directory names is a minor
  taxonomy choice. Alternative was a `roles/` subdirectory. The current
  flat structure under `agents/_defaults/<runtime>/` keeps roles next
  to `user`/`team` types — coherent. Accepted.
- **Verdict: APPROVE** — scope is right-sized; success is measurable.

**Acting as QA** (priority: testing, edge-cases, regression):

- **Q: What happens if input is empty/null/invalid?** Edge cases table
  in spec covers: v1+subagents key, v2+empty subagents, missing inner
  model, anthropic-as-subagent, same-provider-conflict. ✅
- **Q: How do we handle network failures here?** Subagent endpoint
  unreachable: documented (provision succeeds, runtime errors surface
  in chat). Egress proxy down: documented (self-heal). Egress missing:
  documented (warn at provision, 403 at runtime). ✅
- **Q: Is this covered by existing integration tests?** New test
  surface explicitly listed in spec § "Test plan summary" (≈30 new
  test cases). Existing Feature #27 tests must remain green
  (regression). ✅
- **Concern raised**: Hermes degraded-mode warning is fired once per
  process via `sync.Map` (matches `overlayWarningOnce` pattern). Is this
  visible enough? Operators running `conga refresh-all` may miss
  per-agent warnings in stderr. QA verdict: **acceptable for v2**
  — same visibility pattern as Feature #27's "missing version" and
  "nonstandard base_url" warnings. If observability becomes important,
  spec lists it in "Out-of-scope" (subagent observability).
- **Concern raised**: spec § "Edge cases" mentions "operator passes
  `--role X` to an existing agent that has agent.yaml; existing files
  preserved." QA wants explicit test for this (idempotency of `--role`
  on a provisioned agent). Added to Phase 6 acceptance criteria
  implicitly; **promote to explicit Phase 6 test**.
- **Verdict: APPROVE with note** — promote the `--role` idempotency
  case to an explicit test in Phase 6.

### Synthesis

All three personas APPROVE. One QA note: explicit test for `--role`
idempotency (running `--role X` on an existing customized agent
preserves customizations). Adding that to spec.md Phase 6 acceptance.

### 2026-05-22 — Standards Gate Report (pre-implementation)

Standards scanned: `architecture.md`, `config-taxonomy.md`,
`egress-controls.md`, `security.md`. No `index.yml`; standards treated
per their explicit severity markers (`Severity: must` for Agent Data
Safety, Interface Parity, Module Structure; everything else severity:
should). No `philosophies/` directory.

| Standard | Scope | Severity | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| Provider contract / interface parity | architecture.md | must | ✅ PASSES — CLI + JSON + MCP all updated for `--role` |
| Agent Data Safety | architecture.md | must | ✅ PASSES — explicit § "Agent Data Safety" in spec; no data dir touches |
| Module Structure (`pkg/` vs `internal/`) | architecture.md | must | ✅ PASSES — overlay types in `pkg/runtime/`, helpers in `pkg/common/`, CLI in `internal/cmd/`, MCP in `internal/mcpserver/` |
| CLI Conventions | architecture.md | should | ✅ PASSES — `--role` flag uses Cobra; mutex with `--type` documented |
| Config Format Boundary | architecture.md | should | ✅ PASSES — YAML for operator-authored overlay (existing pattern), no new config file |
| Package Boundaries | architecture.md | should | ✅ PASSES — `pkg/runtime/` owns overlay types, `pkg/common/` owns shared helpers, providers stay transport-only |
| Channel abstraction (no new Slack coupling) | architecture.md | should | ✅ PASSES — feature is channel-agnostic |
| Testing Conventions | architecture.md | should | ✅ PASSES — table-driven tests, `t.TempDir()`, real behavior |
| Per-agent config taxonomy: decision rule | config-taxonomy.md | should | ✅ PASSES — subagent declaration is runtime-consumed, operator-authored, provider-agnostic → `agent.yaml` is the right layer |
| Anti-pattern: no secret VALUES in agent.yaml | config-taxonomy.md | should | ⚠️ INITIAL WARNING — spec was silent on subagent's API key storage. **Resolved** by adding § "Secrets handling for subagent providers" to spec.md explicitly stating: existing `openai-api-key` secret reused; no new secret names |
| Anti-pattern: no new YAML file per concern | config-taxonomy.md | should | ✅ PASSES — extends `agent.yaml` with `subagents:` (v2 schema bump) |
| Secrets via env vars, never in config | security.md | must | ✅ PASSES — subagent API key flows via existing `OPENAI_API_KEY` env injection |
| Egress secure-by-default | security.md / egress-controls.md | must | ✅ PASSES — subagent endpoint requires explicit egress allowlist entry; spec auto-derives + warns at provision (Option 3) but does not auto-add (preserves operator authority over egress) |
| Universal baseline (container hardening, etc.) | security.md | must | ✅ PASSES — no container, port, or capability changes |
| Pinned image | security.md | must | ✅ PASSES — feature targets the already-pinned `v2026.5.18` |

**Summary**: 0 ❌ VIOLATIONS, 1 ⚠️ WARNING (resolved during the gate
by adding § "Secrets handling for subagent providers" to spec.md),
0 ℹ️ NOTES.

**Gate decision: PROCEED** — spec ready for implementation.

### 2026-05-22 — Session Resume (Implementation Phase)

User invoked `/glados:implement-feature`. Re-read spec.md (5 sections,
8 phases, ~30 tests planned). Active capabilities for this phase:

- `go test ./...` (full test suite, currently green)
- `gh` CLI (for upstream OpenClaw / Hermes lookups)
- File ops + code search
- Live AWS environment via the conga MCP server (NOT engaged unless
  Aaron explicitly asks for a live smoke this session)

No browser/UI capability needed (pure runtime + config work).

### 2026-05-22 — Phase 1 implementation complete

**Scope chosen (with Aaron)**: Phase 1 only (smallest verifiable
change); commit per phase.

**Files modified**:
- [pkg/runtime/overlay.go](../../pkg/runtime/overlay.go) — bumped
  `CurrentOverlaySchemaVersion` 1 → 2; added `SubagentsOverlay`
  struct + validation; added v1-with-subagents friendly rejection;
  added cross-block same-provider-conflict check.
- [pkg/runtime/overlay_test.go](../../pkg/runtime/overlay_test.go) —
  updated existing version test to accept v2 / reject v3; added 8
  new test functions covering subagents validation surface.
- [pkg/common/overlay_agent_test.go](../../pkg/common/overlay_agent_test.go)
  — replaced `Version2Rejected` with `Version2Accepted` and
  `Version3Rejected`; added 5 new tests for loader-level v2 + subagents
  flow (happy path, v1-with-subagents friendly error, strict-key
  inside subagents block, primary+subagent shape, same-provider
  conflict).

**Files NOT modified** (verified during implementation):
- `pkg/common/overlay_agent.go` — no edits needed. The friendly
  v1+subagents rejection happens at `AgentOverlay.Validate()` time;
  the loader's existing `fmt.Errorf("%s: %w", path, err)` wraps it
  with the file path. `subagents` was never in `reservedTopLevelKeys`.

**Implementation notes**:
- The `Version` switch in `Validate()` now accepts `0, 1, 2`
  explicitly. v1 documents continue to work unchanged.
- `subagents` validation reuses `ModelOverlay.validate()` for the
  inner model — so `anthropic` is already implicitly rejected (it's
  not in the existing provider enum). No special-case needed for v2's
  "no anthropic as subagent" rule.
- Same-provider conflict check uses trimmed-trailing-slash comparison
  so `https://api.openai.com/v1` and `https://api.openai.com/v1/` are
  treated as the same endpoint.

**Verification**:
- `go test ./pkg/runtime/... ./pkg/common/...` green
- `go test ./...` (full suite) green — no regressions
- `go vet ./...` clean
- `gofmt -l pkg/runtime/ pkg/common/` clean (one auto-fix applied
  during run, committed)
- Per-test verification: all 8 new validation tests pass; all 7 new
  loader tests pass (incl. updated v3-rejected case).

**Next**: commit Phase 1 on the worktree branch. Phases 2–8 deferred
to follow-up sessions per Aaron's scope choice.

### 2026-05-22 — Phase 2 implementation complete

User said "continue" — implemented Phase 2 (OpenClaw generator).

**Files modified**:
- [pkg/runtime/openclaw/config.go](../../pkg/runtime/openclaw/config.go) —
  added `applySubagentsOverlay` helper; wired into `GenerateConfig`
  after the existing `applyModelOverlay` call. Imports `strings` for
  the trailing-slash normalization helper.
- [pkg/runtime/openclaw/config_test.go](../../pkg/runtime/openclaw/config_test.go)
  — added 7 new test functions covering the upstream config shape,
  delegationMode + maxConcurrent emission, max_spawn_depth filtering
  (Hermes-only), v2-without-subagents byte-equality with v1,
  allowlist merging, same-provider append, and same-provider conflict
  defense-in-depth.

**Key implementation decisions**:
- `max_spawn_depth` is read from the overlay but NOT emitted in the
  OpenClaw output (it's a Hermes-only knob). This matches spec.md's
  generator section. A regression test guards against accidental
  emission.
- Same-provider handling: when the primary already configured
  `models.providers.<id>` with the same base_url as the subagent,
  the generator appends the subagent model to the existing entry's
  `models[]` array rather than creating a duplicate provider entry
  or clobbering. Different base_urls trigger a defense-in-depth
  error (Validate catches this first in normal flow).
- Field omission: `delegationMode` and `maxConcurrent` are omitted
  from output when unset, so OpenClaw falls back to its own defaults
  (no zero values, no nulls — matches the existing pattern from
  `applyModelOverlay` for capability caps).

**Verification**:
- `go test ./pkg/runtime/openclaw/ -run 'Subagents|V2NoSubagents'`:
  all 7 new tests pass.
- `go test ./...` full suite: green.
- `go vet ./...`: clean.
- `gofmt -l pkg/runtime/ pkg/common/`: clean.
- Feature #27 regression check: existing `TestGenerateConfig_*Overlay`
  tests still pass unchanged.

**Next**: Phase 3 (Hermes generator). Commit Phase 2 first.

### 2026-05-22 — Phase 3 implementation complete

**Files modified/created**:
- [pkg/runtime/hermes/config.go](../../pkg/runtime/hermes/config.go)
  — added `applySubagentsOverlay` helper + `hermesKnownProviderHosts`
  list + `emitHermesDegradedWarning` (`sync.Map`-based dedup) +
  `stderrWriter` indirection for testability. Wired into the existing
  `GenerateConfig`. Imports `os` and `sync`.
- [pkg/runtime/hermes/config_test.go](../../pkg/runtime/hermes/config_test.go)
  — **new file** (Hermes had no test files before this phase). 9 test
  functions covering the no-overlay baseline, v2-without-subagents
  byte-equality, ollama transparent inheritance, openai degraded-mode
  warning, openrouter-host no-warning, Hermes-specific config key
  naming (`max_concurrent_children`, `max_spawn_depth`),
  `delegation_mode` filtering, and warning dedup.

**Key implementation decisions**:
- **`stderrWriter` indirection** instead of `os.Stderr` directly:
  lets tests redirect output to a pipe without touching the global,
  which would race with other tests if the package ever grows
  parallel tests.
- **`hermesKnownProviderHosts` is a simple substring list**, not a
  full URL parser. Easier to maintain; Hermes' enum is small (5 hosts)
  and a substring check is precise enough — `openrouter.ai` doesn't
  collide with any other entry.
- **No mapping attempted** from our overlay's `{ollama, openai}` enum
  to Hermes' `{openrouter, nous, zai, kimi-coding, minimax}` enum.
  Doing so would require new overlay metadata operators can't
  currently supply, and it bakes in assumptions about Hermes' adapter
  resolution that may change upstream. The degraded-mode warning is
  the honest answer.
- **`delegation_mode` actively filtered out** of Hermes output even
  if the operator set it in the overlay. The Hermes runtime doesn't
  recognize it and emitting it would just pollute the config. A
  dedicated regression test catches accidental emission.

**Verification**:
- `go test ./pkg/runtime/hermes/`: all 9 new tests pass.
- `go test ./...` full suite: green.
- `go vet ./...`: clean.
- `gofmt -l pkg/runtime/ pkg/common/`: clean.

**Generator parity achieved**: a v2 overlay with a `subagents:` block
now produces correctly-shaped config on both runtimes. Phases 4–8
(egress check, role packages, CLI flag, docs, verification) remain.
